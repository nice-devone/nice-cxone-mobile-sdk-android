# About

This is a sample implementation of the UI for CXOne Chat SDK, which allows easier integration of SDK into
the intended target application.

## Requirements:

This module requires that integrating uses Hilt during it's build process and it also has to provide instance of `Logger`
with `UiQualifier`.
