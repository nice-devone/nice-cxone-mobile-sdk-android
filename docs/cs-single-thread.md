# Case Study: Single Thread

Whenever you'd like to use only a single thread, regardless of server-side settings, you can take
several shortcuts. Most notably, you can bypass the listing of the threads list and automatically
pick the first conversation or create a new one.

## Libraries

This example uses AndroidX ViewModel libraries to demonstrate the projected usage.

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx:2.5.1"
}
```

### `ChatConversationViewModel.kt`

For the sake of brevity, this example omits some features. For full feature-rich ViewModel
visit [CS: Multi Thread][cs-multi-thread].

> As this ViewModel uses a requirement for chat to exist, visit the screen only when you're certain
> that the ChatInstanceProvider::chat is not null, otherwise the app will crash.

Example below can be simplified with frameworks, visit [CS: Coroutines][cs-coroutines] for more
info.

```kotlin
class ChatConversationViewModel : ViewModel() {

    private val chat = ChatInstanceProvider.get().chat.let(::requireNotNull)
    private val handlerThreads = chat.threads()
    private lateinit var handlerThread: ChatThreadHandler
    private lateinit var cancellableThreads: Cancellable
    private var cancellableThread: Cancellable? = null
    var thread: ChatThread? = null
        private set

    init {
        cancellableThreads = handlerThreads.threads { // (1)
            cancellableThreads.cancel() // (2)
            handlerThread = when (val thread = it.firstOrNull()) { // (3)
                null -> handlerThreads.create()
                else -> handlerThreads.thread(thread)
            }
            cancellableThread = handlerThread.get { // (4)
                thread = it
                // notify ui
            }
        }
    }

    override fun onCleared() {
        cancellableThreads.cancel()
        cancellableThread?.cancel()
    }

}
```

- (1) Fetch a current Threads list
  - Note the `refresh` call after setting a listener
- (2) Cancel the Threads listener
  - We need to dispose of the Threads listener to prevent further calls
  - In this case all we care about is the first list
- (3) Create or select a Thread
  - When Thread exists, then pick a thread otherwise create a new one
