     * being processed or sent.
     *
     * If the message has been processed but not sent within a reasonable
     * amount of time, the client is permitted to retry.
     *
     * Execution (processing) of a given message is immediately moved to a
     * background thread, though [listener] will always be invoked on a
     * foreground thread.
     *
     * Note that messages with no test, attachments, or postback specified will
     * be silently ignored.
     *
     * If you are supplying attachments for upload, then be aware of the following.
     *
     * * If attachment misses file name, the file is named to "document"
     * upon being sent to the server. Please take care to provide localized
     * file names if you want to display them to the user.
     *
     * * The upload of files is performed at most **once** before subsequent
     * processing of the message and sending it to the server. If the file
     * call succeeds, it's cached internally to avoid doubling uploads.
     * Therefore, subsequent calls (if the primary were to fail) are much
     * faster. Also, if the user tries to send the same attachment again,
     * it will not be uploaded again instead it's referenced by the origin
     * upload. This cache is active as long as the [ChatBuilder] instance
     * remains the same. Reinitializing the [Chat] doesn't clear the cache.
     *
     * * If any upload of any attachment fails by connection error, [listener]
     * will **not** be invoked for even processing triggers. The error is
     * passed to the [ChatStateListener.onChatRuntimeException] as
     * an instance of [com.nice.cxonechat.exceptions.RuntimeChatException.AttachmentUploadError]
     * with information about the failed attachment upload.
     *
     * * If any upload of any attachment fails by server error (returns but an
     * empty body), then the attachment is skipped, and execution continues.
