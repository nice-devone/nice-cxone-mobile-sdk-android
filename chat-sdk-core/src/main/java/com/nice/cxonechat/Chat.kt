 * Current chat instance. Client is not limited to a single instance of any given chat.

 * They are though advised that creating *CONFLICTING* (or identical) instances with the
 * same configuration may lead to unexpected consequences.
 *
 * After creating an instance via [build][ChatBuilder.build], the customer is automatically
 * authorized if the authorization is enabled and the customer was not previously authorized,
 * otherwise reconnects the customer.
 *
 * It also starts listening for the authorization and updates customer details after
 * customer authorization. The time it takes to reach the device is undefined.
 *
 * Moreover it starts listening to events that modify welcome messages. Therefore welcome
 * message is only available after we receive the given event and requires no actions from
 * client side. The time it takes to reach the device is undefined.
